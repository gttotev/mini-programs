Dollar Words
=============

Finds all words in a dictionary whose alphabet values (cents) add up to 100 ($1).<br />
<strong>ex.</strong> ``yelpers`` --> ``25(y) + 5(e) + 12(l) + 16(p) + 5(e) + 18(r) + 19(s)`` = ``100``<br /><br />

From the program's UI (``index.html``) you can upload a dictionary file to check for Dollar Words.<br />
I have included in this directory ``dictionary.txt``, a file with all the words in the English alphabet for testing.<br />
But if you want to, you can create your own custom dictionary to test.
The dictionary file must be a list of words, one per line, made up of ASCII letter characters only.
