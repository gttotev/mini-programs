mini-programs
=================

These little programs are a fun little collection of a variety of small programs I made over the years to do a variety of fun, useful, interesting, and even weird tasks.

Here are some of them:

<ul>
<li><b>Date Diff</b> - Calculates the difference between two dates in days in a "DIY-ish" way.</li>
<li><b>Dollar Words</b> - Finds all words in a dictionary whose alphabet values (cents) add up to 100 ($1).</li>
<li><b>Mult Calc</b> - Multiplies two very large numbers and gives a precise answer.</li>
<li><b>Rad-Deg Converter</b> - Converts radians entered to degrees.</li>
<li><b>Statistics Helper</b> - Takes in a list of numerical data and performs statistical calculations on it.</li>
<li><b>Stickman Pong</b> - Like the old game pong, but with a twist - you have to hit the stickman to win!</li>
<li><b>Test Taker</b> - Creates a graph and table for some input values based on test scores.</li>
</ul>
