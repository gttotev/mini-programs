mini-programs
=================

These little programs are a fun little collection of a variety of small programs I made over the years to do a variety of fun, 
interesting, and even weird tasks.

Here are some of them:

<ul>

<li><b>Rad-Deg Converter</b> - Converts radians entered to degrees.</li>

<li><b>Date Diff</b> - Calculates the difference between two dates in days in a "DIY-ish" way.</li>

<li><b>Mult Calc</b> - Multiplies two very large numbers and gives a precise answer.</li>

<li><b>Test Taker</b> - Creates a graph and table for some input values based on test scores.</li>

<li><b>Dollar Words</b> - Finds all words that's letters alphabet values add up to 100.</li>

</ul>
